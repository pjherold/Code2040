I tried to create a webapp using React for the challenge. For each of the steps 2-5, users could click a button to make the inital POST request and retrieve the data and another button to display the solution and make the final POST request with the solution. Unfortunately, I ran into Cross Origin Request problems when trying to make the requests to the api. I have the webapp running with default values and my solutions to each of the steps are in the Solutions folder.
